                    <h2>The Idea and The Frustration</h2>
                    <p>Building your first website feels like a huge mountain to climb. I started with a simple idea: to create a helpful platform for students. But the journey from getting a domain name to making it look professional was full of challenges. This post is about what I learned along the way.</p>

                    <h2>Key Lessons for Every Beginner</h2>
                    <p>If you're just starting, keep these things in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Plan First, Code Later:</strong> Before writing a single line of code, I had to decide on a layout. What sections should be there? What should the website look like? Having a blueprint makes coding much easier.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTML is the Skeleton, CSS is the Soul:</strong> It was amazing to see how plain HTML turned into a beautiful website with CSS. Learning about responsiveness (making the site look good on mobile) was the most important part.</li>
                        <li><strong>GitHub Pages is Magic:</strong> For a beginner, the easiest way to host a website for free is GitHub Pages. The process of connecting a custom domain was a bit technical, but totally worth it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Patience is Everything:</strong> From waiting for DNS changes to propagate to fixing small bugs in the mobile menu, patience is the key. Don't get frustrated if things don't work on the first try.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Building this website has been an incredible learning experience. My advice to you is simple: just start. Choose a simple idea, follow a plan, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Your first website won't be perfect, but the lessons you learn will be priceless.</p>
