                    <p>DSA is the foundation of technical interviews at product-based companies. Master these key topics.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Arrays & Strings:</strong> Two Pointers, Sliding Window, String Manipulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Linked Lists:</strong> Traversal, Reversal, Cycle Detection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stacks & Queues:</strong> LIFO/FIFO principles, usage for parentheses validation, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trees & Graphs:</strong> Traversals (BFS, DFS), basic properties of binary search trees.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sorting & Searching Algorithms:</strong> Understand Big O complexity of common sorts (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Binary Search.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Using HashMaps (Objects/Dictionaries) for efficient lookups.</li>

                    <p>For questions like "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge," don't just give a general answer. Use the STAR method to structure your response clearly and effectively.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>S (Situation):</strong> Briefly describe the context. What was the project or situation? (1-2 sentences)</li>
                        <li><strong>T (Task):</strong> What was your specific role or task? What was the goal? (1 sentence)</li>
                        <li><strong>A (Action):</strong> Describe the specific steps *you* took to address the task or challenge. This is the most important part. Use "I" statements (e.g., "I analyzed...", "I implemented..."). (3-4 sentences)</li>
                        <li><strong>R (Result):</strong> What was the outcome of your actions? Quantify it if possible (e.g., "This reduced the error rate by 15%," "It improved performance and was praised by the team lead"). (1-2 sentences)</li>

                    <h2>Common HR Questions</h2>
                    <p>Be prepared for these common non-technical questions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"Tell me about yourself."</strong>
                            <br><em>Tip: Don't just list your resume. Use a "Present-Past-Future" formula. e.g., "Currently, I'm a final year Computer Science student focusing on web development. In the past, I've built several projects using the MERN stack, like a blog API, which taught me a lot about databases and REST principles. In the future, I'm excited to apply these skills to solve real-world problems in a professional environment."</em>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>"What are your strengths and weaknesses?"</strong>
                            <br><em>Tip: For strengths, pick relevant skills (e.g., "quick learner," "problem-solver") and give a brief example. For weaknesses, choose a real but manageable weakness and show how you are working to improve it (e.g., "I used to struggle with public speaking, so I've started actively presenting in my college tech club to improve my confidence.").</em>
                        </li>
                         <li><strong>"Why do you want to work for this company?"</strong>
                            <br><em>Tip: Do your research! Mention something specific about their products, technology, culture, or mission that genuinely interests you. Show that you've put in the effort.</em>

                    <p>For service-based companies and entry-level roles, be ready for these fundamental questions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Explain the 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</strong>
                            <br><em>Answer: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Be ready to briefly explain each.</em>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `UNIQUE KEY` in SQL?</strong>
                            <br><em>Answer: A table can have only one Primary Key, which cannot have NULL values. A table can have multiple Unique Keys, which can have one NULL value.</em>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript?</strong>
                            <br><em>Answer: `var` is function-scoped and hoisted. `let` and `const` are block-scoped. `const` cannot be reassigned, while `let` can.</em>
                        </li>
                         <li><strong>Explain your final year project.</strong>
                            <br><em>Tip: Be passionate! Explain the problem it solves, the technology stack you used, your specific role, and the challenges you faced and overcame.</em>
