                        <p class="content-meta">Frontend Developer Roadmap</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Welcome to the final chapter of the foundational roadmap! You've learned how to build a complete, interactive website. Now, it's time to learn how to manage your code like a professional. This is where **Version Control** comes in.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What is Version Control? (And Why Do I Need It?)</h2>
                    <p>Imagine you're working on your website. You change 3 files... and suddenly, the entire website breaks. You don't remember what you changed. Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It's like a "time machine" for your code.</p>
                    
                    <div class="note">
                        <strong>Analogy:</strong>
                        <br><strong>Without Git:</strong> You save files like `project_final.zip`, `project_REALLY_final.zip`. This is messy.
                        <br><strong>With Git:</strong> You have one project folder. Git automatically saves "snapshots" (called commits) of your project.
                    </div>

                    <h2>Git vs. GitHub: What's the Difference?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Git:</strong> This is the *software* on your computer. It's the "time machine" that tracks your files.</li>
                        <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> This is a *website* (a cloud service). It's a place to store your Git projects (called repositories or "repos") online. It's like a "Google Drive for your code."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You use **Git** on your computer, and then you "push" your project to **GitHub** to back it up.</p>

                    <h2>Core Concept #1: The Basic Workflow (The 3 Stages)</h2>
                    <p>Git has a three-stage process:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Working Directory:</strong> Your project folder where you edit files.</li>
                        <li><strong>Staging Area (Index):</strong> Your "shopping cart." You put the files you want to save in here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repository (`.git` folder):</strong> The "checkout counter." When you "commit," you permanently save everything in your cart as a snapshot.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Core Concept #2: The 5 Basic Commands</h2>
                    <p>You'll use these 5 commands 90% of the time in your terminal.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. `git init`</h3>
                    <p>Turns your project folder into a Git repository. You only run this **once** per project.</p>
<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>

                    <h3>2. `git status`</h3>
                    <p>Your best friend. It *tells you* the current status: which files are changed, staged, etc.</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre>

                    <h3>3. `git add <file>`</h3>
                    <p>Moves a file from the Working Directory to the Staging Area (puts it in your cart).</p>
<pre><code># Add just one file
git add index.html

# A common shortcut to add ALL changed files
git add .
</code></pre>

                    <h3>4. `git commit -m "Your Message"`</h3>
                    <p>The "save" button. It takes *everything* in your Staging Area and saves it as a snapshot. The `-m` flag is for the required "message."</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "Created the basic HTML for homepage"
</code></pre>

                    <h3>5. `git push`</h3>
                    <p>This uploads your local commits from your computer to a remote server like **GitHub**.</p>
<pre><code>git push origin main
</code></pre>
                    
                    <h2>Core Concept #3: Branches (Working in Parallel)</h2>
                    <p>What if you want to try a new feature without breaking your main, working website? You use **branches**. A branch is like making a *copy* of your project.</p>
                    <p>By default, you are on the `main` branch. You can create a new branch (`new-feature`), work on it, and if it works, **merge** it back into `main`. If it fails, you just delete the branch.</p>

<pre><code># Create a new branch AND switch to it
git checkout -b new-feature

# ... (do your work, add, commit) ...

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the 'new-feature' branch into 'main'
git merge new-feature
</code></pre>

                    <h2>Conclusion: Your New Workflow</h2>
                    <p>Your new workflow for *any* project should be:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>**Initialize:** `git init` (once).</li>
                        <li>**Work:** Change your code.</li>
                        <li>**Stage:** `git add .`</li>
                        <li>**Commit:** `git commit -m "Made some changes"`</li>
                        <li>**Push:** `git push origin main` (to back it up).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Congratulations on completing the foundational roadmap. You now have the skills to not only build modern websites but to manage them professionally.</p>
