                    <h2>What is the GitHub Student Developer Pack?</h2>
                    <p>The GitHub Student Developer Pack is a free collection of developer tools and resources available to students. It includes free access to hosting, domain names, premium courses, and much more, valued at thousands of dollars. It's a must-have for every student in tech!</p>

                    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Apply</h2>
                    <p>Hereâ€™s the exact process I followed to get my pack approved:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Sign up on GitHub Education:</strong> Go to the official GitHub Education website and start the application process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: Upload Proof of Enrollment:</strong> You'll need to provide proof that you are currently a student. I used my college fee receipt, which worked perfectly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3: Match Your Details:</strong> Make sure the name on your GitHub profile and your billing information matches the name on your student document. This is where most applications get rejected.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 4: Wait for Approval:</strong> After submitting, the verification is done manually, so it can take a few hours to a few days. You will receive an approval email once it's done.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Common Problems and Solutions</h2>
                    <p>My first application was rejected because my GitHub profile name didn't match my fee receipt. To fix this, I simply updated my profile name under <code>Settings > Profile</code> and added my full name to the <code>Settings > Billing & plans > Payment information</code> section (no card needed, just the name and address). After doing this, my application was approved quickly!</p>
